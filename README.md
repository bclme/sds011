# sds011
SDS011 is a project initiated by me. Basically it is a software that monitors air quality using the sds011 sensor. 
<p><b>It consists of the following Programs:</b></p>
<ol> <li>Visual Basic 6(front end) and reads the data coming fom the SDS011 sensor</li> 
     <li> PHP is used for decoding data collected by the front end application and saves the decoded information to MysSql database</li>
     <li>Python is used to analyse the collected data</li>
<ol>
