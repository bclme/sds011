# sds011
SDS011 is a project initiated by me. Basically it is a software that monitors air quality using the sds011 sensor.

<p>You may refer to my blogpost for more details <a href="https://pythondatascienceprojectsblog.blogspot.com/2022/02/python-ml-analyzing-air-quality.html">Python ML Analyzing Air Quality Obtained from SDS011 Sensor via VB6/PHP</a> 
<p><b>It consists of the following Programs:</b></p>
<ol> <li>Visual Basic 6(front end) and reads the data coming fom the SDS011 sensor</li> 
     <li> PHP is used for decoding data collected by the front end application and saves the decoded information to MysSql database</li>
     <li>Python is used to analyse the collected data</li>
<ol>    
     
     <p><b>DISCLAIMER</b>
          <p>This is just a personal project so pls expect the quality of the code(naming convention, coding algorith, etc) are not of commercial quality.
